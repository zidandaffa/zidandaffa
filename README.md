## 👋 About Me:
As a recent graduate, I possess a strong enthusiasm and curiosity for continuous learning to deepen my knowledge about technology, which is constantly evolving, especially in the field of Software Quality Assurance. I have the ability to identify software issues, ensure that applications and systems meet established quality standards, conduct both functional and non-functional testing, and meticulously compile detailed reports and documentation of test results. I am very enthusiastic about Software Quality Assurance because I believe that software quality is the foundation of a company's success in the ever-evolving technology era.
